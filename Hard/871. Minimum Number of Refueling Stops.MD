**1. Dynamic Programming**  
Let's determine dp[i], the farthest location we can get to using i refueling stops.  
Soulution given by LeetCode:  
* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of stations.  
* Space Complexity: O(N), the space used by dp.   
```py
# 1048ms
class Solution(object):
    def minRefuelStops(self, target, startFuel, stations):
        dp = [startFuel] + [0] * len(stations)
        for i, (location, capacity) in enumerate(stations):
            for t in xrange(i, -1, -1):
                if dp[t] >= location:
                    dp[t+1] = max(dp[t+1], dp[t] + capacity)

        for i, d in enumerate(dp):
            if d >= target: return i
        return -1
```
I use the recursive formula:```dp[i] = dp[i-1] + maxFuel```.  
Everytime the car arrive at a station with ```maxFuel```(the most refuel), we remove the station from ```stations```.  
If ```maxFuel == 0 ```, it means the car can't reach the next station. So we can ```return -1```.  
If ```dp[i] > target```, it means ```i``` is just the answer.
So the time complexity is still O(N^2) but reduced.  
```py
# 84ms
class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    
        if startFuel >= target:
            return 0
        elif len(stations) == 0:
            return -1
        n = len(stations)
        
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[0] = startFuel
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            
            # find the most refuel the car can get within i station 
            maxFuel, maxarg = 0, -1
            for k, station in enumerate(stations):
                if station[0] <= dp[i-1]:
                    if station[1] > maxFuel:
                        maxFuel = station[1]
                        maxarg = k
                        
            # the car can't reach the next station
            if maxFuel == 0:
                return -1 
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + maxFuel
            
            # remove the station the car has arrived at
            stations.pop(maxarg)
            if dp[i] >= target: return i
        return -1
```
Another way to find ```maxFuel```(Using ```max()```).  
```py
# 116ms
class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if startFuel >= target:
            return 0
        elif len(stations) == 0:
            return -1
        n = len(stations)
        dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]
        dp[0] = startFuel
        for i in range(1, n+1):
        
            within = [station for station in stations if station[0] <= dp[i-1]]
            if len(within) == 0:
                return -1
            
            Fuel = [stop[1] for stop in within]
            maxFuel = max(Fuel)
            maxarg = Fuel.index(maxFuel)
            max_loc = [stop[0] for stop in within][maxarg]
            
            stations.remove([max_loc, maxFuel])
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + maxFuel
            if dp[i] >= target: return i
        return -1
```
**2. Heap**  
* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the length of stations.
* Space Complexity: O(N), the space used by pq.  
```py
class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, startFuel: int, stations: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pq = [] # priorityqueue
        stations.append((target, float('inf')))
        
        n, loc = 0, 0
        tank = startFuel
        for dis, fuel in stations:
            if tank > target - loc:
                return n
            tank -= dis - loc
            while pq and tank < 0:
                tank += -heapq.heappop(pq)
                n += 1
            if tank < 0: return -1
            heapq.heappush(pq, -fuel)
            loc = dis
        return n
```
```py
class Solution:
    def minRefuelStops(self, target: int, tank: int, s: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pq = []
        res, i = 0, 0
        while tank < target:
            while i < len(s) and s[i][0] <= tank:
                heapq.heappush(pq, -s[i][1])
                i += 1
            if not pq: return -1
            tank += -heapq.heappop(pq)
            res += 1
        return res
```
